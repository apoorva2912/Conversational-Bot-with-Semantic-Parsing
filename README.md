# Conversational-Bot-with-Semantic-Parsing

Design Challenge: Conversational Bot with Semantic Parsing

Purpose Statement: The purpose of this project is to create a functional chatbot that is trained to a customer database which parses text input and returns corresponding SQL query as an output.

We utilized the Chat GPT-3.5-turbo api in order to generate robust text-to-SQL queries.

To measure accuracy, we used the Levenshtein distance to determine how close our model's predictions were to the real output.

All processing time was recorded and can be clearly shown while running individual code blocks.
